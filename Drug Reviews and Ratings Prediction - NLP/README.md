# Drug Reviews Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## Overiew

In This Project we are doing Exploratory Data Analysis and Sentiment Analysis on the dataset of drug reviews using Natural Language Processing.

## Steps Followed

* Import all the necessary libraries required in this project Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, XGBClassifier etc.
* Import the train and test datasets.
* Check the data for Null Values and describe it for thorough overview.
* Perform EDA on different features from data using different types of charts from Matplolib and Seaborn.
* Do the Feature Engineering using available features like make a new feature of clean reviews, Word count, Unique Word count, stopwords count  and average word length.
* Encode required features using LabelEncoder.
* Split the data in appropriate proportions using train test split passing necessary numerical features.
* Finally train the model on the training dataset, test it and check the accuracy.

## Conclusion

We predicted the sentiment of user reviews of available drugs using Natural Language Processing and XG Boost Model.
